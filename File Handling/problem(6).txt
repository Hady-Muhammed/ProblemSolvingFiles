| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 4:00

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int count = 0;
            char ch,f[50];
            FILE *fptr;
        printf("Input the file name to be opened : ");scanf("%s",f);
        if((fptr = fopen(f,"r")) == NULL){
            printf("File cannot be opened!");
        }
        else{   printf("\n\nThe content of the file %s are :\n",f);
            while((ch = fgetc(fptr))!=EOF){
               if(ch == '\n')
                    count++;
                printf("%c",ch);
            }
            fclose(fptr);
            printf("\nThe lines in the file are: %d",count+1);
        }


}
