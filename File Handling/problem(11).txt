| PROBLEM | :

Write a program in C to copy a file in another name. 

Assume that the content of the file test.txt is :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4                                                                                                   
Test Data :
Input the source file name : test.txt
Input the new file name : test1.txt
Expected Output :

 The file test.txt  copied successfully in the file test1.txt.
If you read the new file you will see the content of the file :

test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4 


| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 6:53

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :


#include <stdio.h>

int main(){     char f[50],nf[50],ch;
                FILE *fptr,*nfptr;
            printf("Input the source file name : ");scanf("%s",f);
            printf("Input the new file name : ");scanf("%s",nf);
            if((fptr = fopen(f,"r")) == NULL)
                printf("File cannot be opened!");
            else{   nfptr = fopen(nf,"a+");
                while((ch = fgetc(fptr)) != EOF){
                    fputc(ch,nfptr);
                }
                fclose(nfptr);
                printf("\nThe file %s  copied successfully in the file %s.",f,nf);

                fclose(fptr);

                nfptr = fopen(nf,"a+");
                printf("\n\nIf you read the new file you will see the content of the file :\n");
                while((ch = fgetc(nfptr)) != EOF){
                    printf("%c",ch);
                }
                fclose(nfptr);
            }


}
