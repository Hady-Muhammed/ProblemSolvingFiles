| PROBLEM | :

 Write a program in C to append multiple lines at the end of a text file. 

Assume that the content of the file test.txt is :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4                                                                                                   
Test Data :
Input the file name to be opened : test.txt
Input the number of lines to be written : 3
The lines are :
test line 5
test line 6
test line 7
Expected Output :

The content of the file test.txt is  :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4                                                                                                   
                                                                                                              
test line 5                                                                                                   
test line 6                                                                                                   
test line 7

| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 5:29

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :



#include <stdio.h>

int main(){     int n;
            char line[50],f[50],ch;
            FILE *fptr;
            printf("Input the file name to be opened : ");scanf("%s",f);
            printf("Input the number of lines to be written : ");scanf("%d",&n);
            printf("\nThe lines are:\n");
            for(int i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++){
                scanf("%s",line);
                if((fptr = fopen(f,"a")) == NULL)
                    printf("File cannot be opened!");
                else{
                   fprintf(fptr,"\n%s\n",line);
            }
                fclose(fptr);
                }



            printf("The content of the file %s is :\n",f);
        if((fptr = fopen(f,"r")) == NULL)
           printf("File cannot be opened!");
        else{

            while((ch = fgetc(fptr))!=EOF){
                fprintf(stdout,"%c",ch);
            }
            fclose(fptr);
        }

}
