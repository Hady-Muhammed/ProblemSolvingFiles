 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 8:32

 Did i checked the question answer? = YES

 Learned that!



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
            char f[50];
            char str[n][max];
            FILE *fptr; 
        printf("Input the file name to be opened : ");scanf("%s",f);
        if((fptr = fopen(f,"r")) == NULL){
                printf("File cannot be opened!");
           }
        else{       int i = 0;
                while( fgets(str[i],10,fptr) != NULL){

                    i++;
                }
                
           printf("\n The content of the file %s  are : \n",f);
    for(j = 0; j < i; ++i)
    {
        printf("%s\n", str[j]);
    }
    printf("\n");
           }

        

}
