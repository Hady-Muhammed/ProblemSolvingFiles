| PROBLEM | :

Write a program in C to write multiple lines in a text file.
Test Data :
Input the number of lines to be written : 4
:: The lines are ::
test line 1
test line 2
test line 3
test line 4
Expected Output :

 The content of the file test.txt is  :

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int n;
            char c,str[50],f[50];
            FILE *fptr;
        printf("Input the file name: ");scanf("%s",f);
        printf("Input the number of lines to be written : ");scanf("%d",&n);
        printf(":: The lines are ::\n");
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            scanf("%s",str);
           if ((fptr = fopen(f,"a")) == NULL){
            printf("\n\nfile Cannot be opened.");
            return 0;
           }else{
           fputs(str,fptr);
           fprintf(fptr,"\n");
           fclose(fptr);
           }

        }

        printf("\nThe contents of the file %s is :\n",f);

           if ((fptr = fopen(f,"r")) == NULL){
            printf("\n\nfile Cannot be opened.");
            return 0;
           }else{

               while((c = fgetc(fptr)) != EOF){
                    fprintf(stdout,"%c",c);

               }
           fclose(fptr);
           }


}
