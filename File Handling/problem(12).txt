| PROBLEM | :

Write a program in C to merge two files and write it in a new file. 

Assume that the content of the file test.txt and test1.txr is :                                                                       
 The content of the file test.txt is  : 
This is the file test.txt. 

 The content of the file test1.txt is  : 
This is the file test1.txt.                                                                                                    
Test Data :
Input the 1st file name : test.txt
Input the 2nd file name : test1.txt
Input the new file name where to merge the above two files : mergefiles.txt
Expected Output :

 The two files merged into mergefiles.txt file successfully..!! 
Here is the content of the merge file mergefiles.txt :

 The content of the file mergefiles.txt is  :                                                                 
This is the file test.txt.                                                                                    
This is the file test1.txt.

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :


#include <stdio.h>

int main(){     char f1[50],f2[50],nf[50],c;
            FILE *f1ptr,*f2ptr,*nfptr;
            printf("Input the 1st file name : ");scanf("%s",f1);
            printf("Input the 2nd file name : ");scanf("%s",f2);
            printf("Input the new file name where to merge the above two files : ");
            scanf("%s",nf);
            f1ptr = fopen(f1,"r");
            f2ptr = fopen(f2,"r");
            nfptr = fopen(nf,"a");
            if(f1ptr == NULL || f2ptr == NULL){
                printf("Files Cannot be opened!");
                return 0;
            }
           while((c = fgetc(f1ptr)) != EOF){
                fputc(c,nfptr);
                 }
                 fclose(f1ptr);
           while((c = fgetc(f2ptr)) != EOF){
                fputc(c,nfptr);
                 }
                 fclose(f2ptr);
                 fclose(nfptr);

                nfptr = fopen(nf,"a+");
                 printf("\nThe two files merged into %s file successfully..!!\n",nf);
                 printf("\nHere is the content of the merge file %s :\n",nf);
                    while((c = fgetc(nfptr)) != EOF){
                        printf("%c",c);
                    }
                    fclose(nfptr);
