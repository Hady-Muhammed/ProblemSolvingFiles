| PROBLEM | :

Write a program in C to count a number of words and characters in a file. 
Test Data :
Input the file name to be opened : test.txt
Expected Output :

 The content of the file test.txt are :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2

test line 4                                                                                                   
 The number of words in the  file test.txt are : 12                                                           
 The number of characters in the  file test.txt are : 36

| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 4:54

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :


#include <stdio.h>

int main(){     int chars = 0 , words = 0;
                char ch,f[50];
                FILE *fptr;
        printf("Input the file name to be opened : ");scanf("%s",f);
        if((fptr = fopen(f,"r")) == NULL){
            printf("File cannot be opened!");
        }
        else{   printf(" The content of the file %s are : \n",f);

        while((ch = fgetc(fptr)) != EOF){
            printf("%c",ch);
        if(ch != ' ' && ch !='\n'){
            chars++;
        }else{
            words++;
        }
        }
 fclose(fptr);
        printf("\n\nThe number of words in the  file test.txt are : %d",words+1);
        printf("\nThe number of characters in the  file test.txt are : %d",chars);

        }



        
        }
