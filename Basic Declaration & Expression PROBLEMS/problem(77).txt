 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
        int amount,days;
        float interest,rate;
    printf("Input loan amount (0 to quit): ");scanf("%d",&amount);
    if(amount==0)
        return 0;
    printf("\nInput interest rate: ");scanf("%f",&rate);

    printf("\nInput term of the loan in days: ");scanf("%d",&days);

    interest = (amount * rate * days) / 365.0;

    printf("\n\nThe interest amount is $%f",interest);
