| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program to read the coordinates(x, y) (in Cartesian system) and find the quadrant to which it belongs (Quadrant -I, Quadrant -II, Quadrant -III, Quadrant -IV).
Note: A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates.
These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by Roman numerals: I (where the signs of the (x,y) coordinates are I(+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), and IV (+,−).
Test Data :
Input the Coordinate(x,y):
x: 25
y: 15
Expected Output:
Quadrant-I(+,+)




| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 4:06

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    int x,y;

       printf("Input the coordinate(x,y):\n ");
       printf("x: ");scanf("%d",&x);
       printf("\ny: ");scanf("%d",&y);

    if(x > 0 && y > 0)
            printf("\nQuadrant-1(+,+)");
else if(x < 0 && y > 0)
            printf("\nQuadrant-2(-,+)");
else if(x < 0 && y < 0)
            printf("\nQuadrant-3(-,-)");
else
            printf("\nQuadrant-4(+,-)");


}
