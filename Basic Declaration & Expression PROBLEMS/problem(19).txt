| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program that accepts 4 integers p, q, r, s from the user where q, r and s are positive and p is even. If q is greater than r and s is greater than p and if the sum of r and s is greater than the sum of p and q print "Correct values", otherwise print "Wrong values". 
Test Data :
Input the second integer: 35
Input the third integer: 15
Input the fourth integer: 46
Expected Output:
Wrong values

| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 4:44

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | : 

#include <stdio.h>


int main(){
    int q,r,s,p;

    printf("input the first integer :\n");scanf("%d",&q);
    printf("input the second integer :\n");scanf("%d",&r);
    printf("input the third integer :\n");scanf("%d",&s);
    printf("input the fourth integer :\n");scanf("%d",&p);

    if(q > r && s > p && r+s > p+q)
        printf("\nCorrect values");
    else
        printf("\nWrong values");

}
