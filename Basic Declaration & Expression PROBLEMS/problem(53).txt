| PROBLEM | :

 Write a C program that accepts principle, rate of interest, time and compute the simple interest. 
Test Data:
Input Data: p = 10000, r = 10% , t = 12 year
Expected Output:
Input principle, Rate of interest & time to find simple interest:
Simple interest = 12000

| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 2:47

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int p,r,t,SI;
printf("Input principle, Rate of interest & time to find simple interest: \n");
printf("P = ");scanf("%d",&p);
printf("R(%%) = ");scanf("%d",&r);
printf("T = ");scanf("%d",&t);

SI = (p*r*t)/100;
printf("Simple interest: %d",SI);


}
