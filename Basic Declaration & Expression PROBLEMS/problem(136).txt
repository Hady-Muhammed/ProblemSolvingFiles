 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>



int PrimeOrNot(int x){
int count = 0;
    for(int i = 2 ; i <= x ; i++){
        if(x%i==0){
            count++;
        }
    }
  if(count==1)
            return 1;
  else
            return 0;


}


int main(){
    int n;
    int primes=0;
    printf("Input a number:\n");scanf("%d",&n);

    for(int i = n ; i >= 2 ; i--){
    if(PrimeOrNot(i)){
        primes++;
    }
    }
    printf("\nNumber of prime numbers which are less than or equal to %d\n%d",n,primes);
}
