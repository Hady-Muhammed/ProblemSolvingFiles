| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
        int x;
    printf("Input an integer number:");
    scanf("%d",&x);

    printf("Next 10 consecutive odd numbers:\n");
    if(x%2 != 0){
        for(int i = x+2 ; i <= x+20 ; i+=2){
            printf("%d,",i);
        }
    }else{
        for(int i = x+1 ; i <= x+20 ; i+=2){
            printf("%d,",i);
    }
    }

    printf("\n\nNext 10 consecutive even numbers:\n");
     if(x%2 != 0){
        for(int i = x+1 ; i <= x+20 ; i+=2){
            printf("%d,",i);
        }
    }else{
        for(int i = x+2 ; i <= x+20 ; i+=2){
            printf("%d,",i);
    }

    }

}
