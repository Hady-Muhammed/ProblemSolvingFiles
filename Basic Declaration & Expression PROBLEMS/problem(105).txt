 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ float a[7],avg1,avg2,sump=0,sumn=0;
        int positives=0,negatives=0;
    printf("Input 7 numbers(int/float):");
    for(int i = 0 ; i < 7 ; i++){
        scanf("%f",&a[i]);
        if(a[i]>0){ sump+=a[i];
            positives++;}
        else if(a[i]==0){

        }else{ sumn+=a[i];
            negatives++;
        }
    }
avg1 = sump / positives;
avg2 = sumn / negatives;
printf("\n\n%d Number of positive numbers: Average %f",positives,avg1);
printf("\n%d Number of negative numbers: Average %f",negatives,avg2);

}
