Sample Output:
Input each number on a separate line (888 to exit):

The average value of the said numbers is 17.000000


| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 5:16

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ float avg;
        int n,x=0,sum=0;
do{
        avg = (float)sum/x;
    printf("Input each number on a separate line (888 to exit): ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if(n==888)
        printf("The average value of the said numbers is %f",avg);
    else{
    sum+=n;
    x++;
    }
}while(n!=888);


}
