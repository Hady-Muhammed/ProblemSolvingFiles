| PROBLEM | :
Write a C program to calculate the distance between the two points. 
Test Data :
Input x1: 25
Input y1: 15
Input x2: 35
Input y2: 10
Expected Output:
Distance between the said points: 11.1803


| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 18:37

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | : 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    float x1,y1,x2,y2;
    float distance,a,b,c;


    printf("Input x1: ");scanf("%f",&x1);
    printf("Input y1: ");scanf("%f",&y1);
    printf("Input x2: ");scanf("%f",&x2);
    printf("Input y2: ");scanf("%f",&y2);

    a = abs(x2-x1);
    b = abs(y2-y1);
    c = a*a+b*b;

    if(x1==x2)
            printf("Distance between two points = %f",b);


    else if(y1==y2)
            printf("Distance between two points = %f",a);


    else{


    distance = sqrt(c);

    printf("Distance between two points = %f",distance);
    }

}
