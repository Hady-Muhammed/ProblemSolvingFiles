| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program to find and print the square of each even and odd values between 1 and a given number (4 < n < 101).
Sample Output:
Input a number(integer): 15

Square of each even between 1 and 15:
2^2 = 4
4^2 = 16
6^2 = 36
8^2 = 64
10^2 = 100
12^2 = 144
14^2 = 196

Square of each odd between 1 and 15:
1^2 = 1
3^2 = 9
5^2 = 25
7^2 = 49
9^2 = 81
11^2 = 121
13^2 = 169
15^2 = 225

| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 4:12

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int x;
    printf("Input a number(integer): ");scanf("%d",&x);
    if(x > 4 && x < 101){
            printf("Square of each even between 1 and %d:\n",x);
        for(int i = 2 ; i <= x ; i+=2){
            printf("%d^2 = %d\n",i,i*i);
        }
            printf("\n\nSquare of each odd between 1 and %d:\n",x);
        for(int i = 1 ; i <= x ; i+=2){
            printf("%d^2 = %d\n",i,i*i);
        }

    }else{
     printf("\n\nThe integer you entered is too high try lowering it!");
     printf("\nProgram Ended!");
     return 0;
    }
}
