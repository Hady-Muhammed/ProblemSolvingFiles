| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program that accepts a pair of numbers from the user and print the sequence from the lowest to highest number. Also, print the average value of the sequence. 
Sample Output:

Input two pairs values (integer values):
14
25

Sequence from the lowest to highest number:
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
Average value of the said sequence
    19.50
Sample Output:

Input two pairs values (integer values):
35
13

Sequence from the lowest to highest number:
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35
Average value of the said sequence
    24.00




| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 6:00

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int x,y,n,sum=0;
            float avg;
    printf("Input two pairs values (integer values): \n");
    scanf("%d",&x);
    scanf("%d",&y);
    if(x>y){
        x = x+y;
        y = x-y;
        x = x-y;
    }
    n=y-x+1;
    printf("Sequence from the lowest to highest number:\n");
        for(int i = x ; i <= y ; i++){
            printf("%d ",i);
            sum+=i;
        }
      printf("\nAverage value of the said sequence\n");
      avg = (float)sum / n;
      printf("%f",avg);
}
