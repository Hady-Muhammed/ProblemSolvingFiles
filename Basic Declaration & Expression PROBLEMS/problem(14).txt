| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program to calculate a bike’s average consumption from the given total distance (integer value) traveled (in km) and spent fuel (in liters, float number – 2 decimal point). 
Test Data :
Input total distance in km: 350
Input total fuel spent in liters: 5
Expected Output:
Average consumption (km/lt) 70.000
 

| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 3:46

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | : 

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
int fuel,distance;
float avg;

    printf("Input total distance in km : ");
    scanf("%d",&distance);
    printf("Input total fuel spent in liters : ");
    scanf("%d",&fuel);
    avg = distance / (float)fuel;
    printf("Average consumption(km/lt): %f",avg);




}
