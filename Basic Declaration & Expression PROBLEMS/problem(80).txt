| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int s;
    printf("Input the side of the square(side sizes between 1 and 10 ): ");scanf("%d",&s);
    if(s < 1 || s > 10)
        printf("Invalid Input!");
    else{

        for(int i = 1 ; i <= s ; i++){
                for(int j = 1 ; j <= s ; j++){
                        printf("# ");
                }
                printf("\n");
        }


    }

}
