| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
        int x,y,sum=0;
    printf("Input two numbers(integers):\n");
    scanf("%d",&x);
    scanf("%d",&y);
     if(x>y){
        x = x+y;
        y = x-y;
        x = x-y;
    }
    for(int i = x ; i <= y ; i++)
        if(i%7!=0)
            sum+=i;


printf("Sum of all numbers between said numbers (inclusive) not divisible by 7:\n");
printf("%d",sum);

}
