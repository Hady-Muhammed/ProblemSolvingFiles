| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :


#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int mark=1,sum=0,num=0;
    float avg;
    printf("Input Mathematics marks (0 to terminate):\n");
    while(mark!=0){
        scanf("%d",&mark);
        sum+=mark;
        if(mark!=0)
            num++;
    }
    avg = (float)sum/num;
    printf("\n\nAverage marks in Mathematics: %f",avg);
}
