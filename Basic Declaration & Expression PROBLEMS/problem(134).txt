| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program to check whether three given lengths (integers) of three sides of a triangle form a right triangle or not. Print "Yes" if the given sides form a right triangle otherwise print "No". 
Input:
Integers separated by a single space.
1 <= length of the side <= 1,000
Sample Output:

Input the three sides of a trainagel:
12
11
13
It is not a right angle triangle!




| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 3:21

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int x,y,z;
        printf("Input the three sides of a triangle:\n");
        scanf("%d%d%d",&x,&y,&z);
        if( x==sqrt(y*y+z*z) || y==sqrt(x*x+z*z) || z==sqrt(y*y+x*x))
            printf("\nThis is a right angled triangle");
        else
            printf("\nThis is NOT a right angled triangle");
}
