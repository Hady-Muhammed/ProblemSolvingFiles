Sample Output:
Input the currency value (floating point with two decimal places):
10357.75

Currency Notes:
100 number of Note(s): 103
50 number of Note(s): 1
5 number of Note(s): 1
2 number of Note(s): 1

Currency Coins:

| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(){ double n,numF;
            double numD;
            int a=0,b=0,c=0,d=0,e=0,f=0;
    printf("Input the currency value (floating point with two decimal places):");
    scanf("%lf",&n);

 numF = modf(n,&numD); // taking the fraction part in the numF

        printf("Currency Notes:\n");
while(numD >= 100){
    numD-=100;
    a++;
}
while(numD >= 50){
    numD-=50;
    b++;
}
while(numD >= 5){
    numD-=5;
    c++;
}
while(numD >= 2){
    numD-=2;
    d++;
}

printf("100 number of Note(s): %d\n",a);
printf("50 number of Note(s): %d\n",b);
printf("5 number of Note(s): %d\n",c);
printf("2 number of Note(s): %d\n",d);


printf("Currency Coins:\n");

while(numF >= 0.50){
    numF-=0.50;
    e++;
}
while(numF >= 0.25){
    numF-=0.25;
    f++;
}


printf(".50 number of Coin(s): %d\n",e);
printf(".25 number of Coin(s): %d",f);
}
