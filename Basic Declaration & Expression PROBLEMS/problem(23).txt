| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program that reads three floating values and check if it is possible to make a triangle with them. Also calculate the perimeter of the triangle if the said values are valid. 
Test Data :
Input the first number: 25
Input the second number: 15
Input the third number: 35
Expected Output:
Perimeter = 75.0


| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 3:05

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | : 

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    float x,y,z;
        printf("Input the first number: ");scanf("%f",&x);
        printf("Input the second number: ");scanf("%f",&y);
        printf("Input the third number: ");scanf("%f",&z);

        if(x+y+z<=180)
            printf("Perimeter = %f",x+y+z);
        else
            printf("Cannot create a triangle");






}
