| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program that takes two integers and test whether they are multiplies are not. Go to the editor
In science, a multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer. In other words, for the quantities a and b, we say that b is a multiple of a if b = na for some integer n, which is called the multiplier. If a is not zero, this is equivalent to saying that b/a is an integer.
Sample Output:
Input two integers:
3
9
Multiplies

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int x,y;
    printf("Input two integers: ");
    scanf("%d",&x);
    scanf("%d",&y);

    if(x%y==0 || y%x==0)
        printf("Multiplies");
    else
        printf("Not Multiples");

}
