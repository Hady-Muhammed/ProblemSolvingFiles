| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program that accepts a positive integer n less than 100 from the user and prints out the sum 14 + 24 + 44 + 74 + 114 + • • • + m4 , where m is less than or equal to n. Print appropriate message. 
Input a positive number less than 100: 68
Sum of the series is 37361622


| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 18:19

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int j=1,n,sum=0;
    printf("Input a positive number less than 100: ");scanf("%d",&n);

    if(n >= 100 || n < 0)
        printf("Invalid input");
    else{
        for(int i = 1 ; j <= n ; i++){
            sum+=j*j*j*j;
            j=j+i;
        }
        printf("Sum of the series is %d",sum);



    }
