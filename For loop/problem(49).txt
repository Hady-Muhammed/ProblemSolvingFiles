| PROBLEM | :

Write a c program to find out the sum of an A.P. series. 
Test Data :
Input the starting number of the A.P. series: 1
Input the number of items for the A.P. series: 10
Input the common difference of A.P. series: 4
Expected Output :
The Sum of the A.P. series are :
1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 + 25 + 29 + 33 + 37 = 190



| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 5:24

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int x,y,z;
            int sum=0;
    printf("Input the starting number of the A.P. series: ");scanf("%d",&x);
    printf("Input the number of items for the A.P. series: ");scanf("%d",&y);
    printf("Input the common difference of A.P. series: ");scanf("%d",&z);
    printf("\n\nThe Sum of the A.P. series are :\n");
    for(int i = 1 , j = 1 ; i <= 10 ; i++ , j+=4){
        printf(" %d ",j);
        sum+=j;
        if(i==10){
                printf("= %d",sum);
        }else{
            printf("+");
        }
    }

}
