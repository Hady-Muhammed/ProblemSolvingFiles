| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program to find HCF (Highest Common Factor) of two numbers. 
Test Data :
Input 1st number for HCF: 24
Input 2nd number for HCF: 28
Expected Output :
HCF of 24 and 28 is : 4


| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 5:08

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :


#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int n1,n2,hcf,bigger;

    printf("Input 1st number for HCF: ");scanf("%d",&n1);
    printf("Input 2nd number for HCF: ");scanf("%d",&n2);
   if(n1>n2)
       bigger=n1;
   else if(n1<n2)
        bigger=n2;

        for(int i = 2 ; i <= bigger ; i++)
                if(n1%i==0 && n2%i==0)
                        hcf = i;
                
        
        printf("\n\nHCF of %d and %d is : %d",n1,n2,hcf);
}
