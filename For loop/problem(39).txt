 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int sum=0;

    printf("Numbers between 100 and 200, divisible by 9 :\n");

    for(int i = 101 ; i < 200 ; i++)
        if(i%9==0){
            printf("%d ",i);
            sum+=i;
        }

    printf("\nsum : %d",sum);

}
