| PROBLEM | :

Write a program in C to display the n terms of harmonic series and their sum. 
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 ... 1/n terms
Test Data :
Input the number of terms : 5
Expected Output :
1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +
Sum of Series upto 5 terms : 2.283334


| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 2:26

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){     int n;
                float sum=0;
    printf("Input the number of terms : \n");scanf("%d",&n);

    for(int i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++){
        printf("1/%d +",i);
        sum+=1.0/i;
    }
printf("\nSum of Series upto %d terms : %f",n,sum);

}
