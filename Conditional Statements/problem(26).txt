| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 4:10

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){     int x,y,n;
        printf("Input 1st no: ");scanf("%d",&x);
        printf("Input 2nd no: ");scanf("%d",&y);
        printf("1-add | 2-subtract | 3-multiply | 4-divide");
        printf("\nInput operation no: ");scanf("%d",&n);

        switch(n){
    case 1: printf("The Addition of %d and %d is: %d",x,y,x+y);break;
    case 2: printf("The Subtraction of %d and %d is: %d",x,y,x-y);break;
    case 3: printf("The Multiplication of %d and %d is: %d",x,y,x*y);break;
    case 4: printf("The Division of %d and %d is: %d",x,y,x/y);break;
    default: printf("\ninvalid op num!");

        }


}
