| PROBLEM | :

Write a program in C to calculate and print the Electricity bill of a given customer. The customer id., name and unit consumed by the user should be taken from the keyboard and display the total amount to pay to the customer. The charge are as follow : 

Unit	Charge/unit
upto 199	@1.20
200 and above but less than 400	@1.50
400 and above but less than 600	@1.80
600 and above	@2.00
If bill exceeds Rs. 400 then a surcharge of 15% will be charged and the minimum bill should be of Rs. 100/-

Test Data :
1001
James
800
Expected Output :
Customer IDNO :1001
Customer Name :James
unit Consumed :800
Amount Charges @Rs. 2.00 per unit : 1600.00
Surchage Amount : 240.00
Net Amount Paid By the Customer : 1840.00

| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){     int IDNO,unit;
                float rs,surcharge,net;
                char name[20];
    printf("Input IDNO: ");scanf("%d",&IDNO);
    printf("\nInput Customer name: ");scanf("%s",name);
    printf("\nInput unit consumed: ");scanf("%d",&unit);
    if(unit <= 199)
        rs=1.20;
    else if(unit >= 200 && unit < 400)
        rs=1.50;
    else if(unit >= 400 && unit < 600)
        rs=1.80;
    else
        rs=2.00;

    surcharge = rs*unit*15/100.0;
    printf("\n\nCustomer IDNO: %d",IDNO);
    printf("\nCustomer name: %s",name);
    printf("\nunit Consumed: %d",unit);
    printf("\nAmount Charges @Rs : %f per unit : %f",rs,rs*unit);
    if(unit > 400){
            net = unit*rs+surcharge;
        printf("\nSurcharge Amount: %f",surcharge);
        printf("\nNet Amount Paid By the Customer : %f",net);

    }else{  net = unit*rs;
        printf("\nNet Amount Paid By the Customer : %f",net);

    }

}
