| PROBLEM | :

Write a C program to find the eligibility of admission for a professional course based on the following criteria: 
Eligibility Criteria : Marks in Maths >=65 and Marks in Phy >=55 and Marks in Chem>=50 
and Total in all three subject >=190 or Total in Maths and Physics >=140 
------------------------------------- Input the marks obtained in Physics :65 
Input the marks obtained in Chemistry :51 Input the marks obtained in Mathematics :72 
Total marks of Maths, Physics and Chemistry : 188 Total marks of Maths and Physics : 137

Expected Output :
The candidate is not eligible for admission.

| Problem rating | :

 Time taken for the logic thinking & implementing the code = 4:51

 Did i checked the question answer? = NO



| MY ANSWER (Source code) | :

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){ int phy,chem,math,total1,total2;

    printf("Input the marks obtained in Physics : ");scanf("%d",&phy);
    printf("\nInput the marks obtained in Chemistry : ");scanf("%d",&chem);
    printf("\nInput the marks obtained in Mathematics : ");scanf("%d",&math);
    printf("\nTotal marks of Maths, Physics and Chemistry : ");scanf("%d",&total1);
    printf("\nTotal marks of Maths and Physics : ");scanf("%d",&total2);

 if(math >= 65 && phy >= 55 && chem >= 50 && total1 >= 190 && total2 >= 140)
    printf("\nThe candidate is  eligible for admission.");
 else
    printf("\nThe candidate is not eligible for admission.");
}
